## üåê Overview

PinDoster is a comprehensive network analysis tool designed for security professionals, network administrators, and educational purposes. It provides deep insight into network traffic with advanced protocol analysis and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìä Real-time packet capture and protocol analysis
- üîÑ Support for multiple protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, SMTP)
- üî¨ Deep packet inspection with protocol-specific analysis
- üß© Advanced protocol fingerprinting for ambiguous traffic
- üö® Traffic pattern detection and anomaly alerts
- üìà Interactive dashboard with live visualization
- üì∂ Connection tracking and bandwidth monitoring

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies:
  - scapy >= 2.6.1
  - rich >= 14.0.0
  - prompt_toolkit
- Administrator/root privileges (required for raw packet capture)
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nekicj/PinDoster.git
cd PinDoster
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

```bash
# Install main dependencies
pip install rich scapy prompt_toolkit

# Or if a requirements file exists
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

PinDoster offers two primary modes of operation:

### Interactive Mode

The interactive mode provides a command-line interface for exploring network traffic with rich, interactive controls:

```bash
# Launch interactive mode
python -m src.main interactive
```

### Capture Mode

Capture mode allows you to capture and analyze packets directly:

```bash
# Start packet capture
python -m src.main capture
```

For both modes, you may need to run the command with administrator/root privileges to capture packets properly:

```bash
# On Windows (Run PowerShell or CMD as Administrator)
python -m src.main capture

# On macOS/Linux
sudo python -m src.main capture
```
